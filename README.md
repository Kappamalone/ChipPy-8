# ChipPy-8
An attempt at writing a chip-8 emulator in python to learn more about computer architecture, and to hopefully branch

# Getting it up and running
You'll need to have python 3 installed on your system as well as pygame. Install pygame using 'pip install pygame'.
Then to run the emulator, type this into your cmd: 'python window.py [your/rom/path] [speed]. Most games run fine at a speed of 
around 500-800. The keybindings are as follows:

# Resources used
I used three main sources to write most of the emulator.

As well as some very helpful advice from the folks over at the r/emudev discord :D
